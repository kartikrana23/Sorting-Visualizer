Sorting Visualizer

Project Overview:-

The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work.
It allows users to adjust the array size and sorting speed and provides dynamic visual feedback during the sorting process. 
The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

Generate New Array: Create a new array with random values.

Adjustable Sorting Speed: Use a slider to control the speed of the sorting animations.

Adjustable Array Size: Use a slider to change the number of bars (array size) in the visualization.

Sorting Algorithms Supported:Bubble Sort,Selection Sort,Insertion Sort,Merge Sort,Quick Sort,Heap Sort.

Dynamic Visualization: Bars change color to indicate comparisons and swaps during sorting.

Responsive Design: The interface adapts to different screen sizes.

Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the web page.

CSS: For styling the interface and animations.

JavaScript: For implementing sorting algorithms and interactive functionality.

How to Use

Open the project in any modern web browser.

Use the "Generate New Array" button to create a new array.

Adjust the array size and sorting speed using the respective sliders.

Select a sorting algorithm by clicking one of the buttons (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).

Watch the sorting process visualized in real-time.

Project Structure

index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.

Sorting.css: The CSS file for styling the visualizer, including the bars and controls.

Sorting.js: The JavaScript file containing logic for generating arrays, handling user input, and implementing sorting algorithms.

Sorting Algorithms Explained

Bubble Sort

Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Visualized by highlighting the bars being compared and swapped.

Selection Sort

Finds the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first element in the unsorted part.

Insertion Sort

Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the correct position.

Merge Sort

A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into smaller parts, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

Quick Sort

Picks a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. Recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

Heap Sort

Builds a max heap from the array and repeatedly swaps the root with the last element, reducing the heap size each time.

Customization

Default bar color: Green

Swap bar color: Red

Sorting speed and array size are dynamically adjustable using sliders.

Known Issues

Sorting stops if a new array is generated during the process.

Sorting speed adjustment is non-linear.

Future Improvements

Add more sorting algorithms like Shell Sort and Radix Sort.

Improve the slider interaction for smoother adjustments.

Provide a step-by-step mode for educational purposes.

How to Run

Clone or download the repository.

Open the index.html file in a browser.

Start experimenting with the sorting visualizer.
